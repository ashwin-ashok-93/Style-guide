# The Modables Style Guide

>" In character, in manner, in style, in all things, the supreme excellence is simplicity."

> Henry Wadsworth Longfellow


This Document outlines and elaborates the guidelines for writing clean and practical looking code for the modables-dsl.

Since modables-dsl is implemented in Ruby, most of the style rules are based on Ruby's Style guidelines.

##Source Code Layout

Every modables-dsl file starts with a `morb do` statement and ends with a `end` statement.

~~~Ruby
morb do
    
  blocks do
    
    sub-block 

  end

end
~~~

Each block between a `do` and `end` block starts is indented.

Use two *spaces* per indentation level (aka soft tabs). No hard tabs.


##Key value pairs

key value pairs are separated by space

~~~Ruby
key "value"
~~~
